      <h1 class="title"> Program Summary</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Literature Review</h2>
      <p>Middle school is a vital and formational time in the lives of students.  What happens in middle school affects students during those years and future educational endeavors.  Student experiences in middle school are likely to impact students in the future in such areas as delinquency, attendance, and graduation (Tomek, Bolland, Hooper, Hitchcock, & Bolland, 2017).  Of course, these experiences also affect students in the moment.   School connectedness was found to be a key factor for Black students in predicting high school behaviors including enrollment during the final two years, school connectedness, and suspension.  In the middle school years, connectedness at that level does correlate with attendance and discipline during middle school (Tomek et al., 2017).  With the significance of connectedness and belonging during these years, it is essential for schools to develop programs that allow all students to gain a sense of belonging and engagement.</p>
      <br>
      <p>One standard way to attempt to foster school connection is through extracurriculars such as clubs and sports.  In a study of the Chinese school system, extracurriculars were found to not correlate to increased creative and critical thinking.  Students who were low achievers in mathematics were able to think creatively and critically and increased their math achievement with intervention (Liu, He, & Li, 2015). It is, therefore, necessary to foster connectedness through curricula that allow for creativity and critical thinking.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Student interest is a critical element in providing students with significant learning opportunities and often overlooked in school curriculums (Buchanan, Harlan, Bruce, & Edwards, 2016; Evans & Boucher, 2015).  Student interest without rigorous thinking is not enough, however.  The work provided needs to be of an appropriate difficulty level that provides a challenge while students believe that they can be successful (Evans & Boucher, 2015).  Care also needs to be taken in order to avoid choice overload which overwhelms students (Evans & Boucher, 2015).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Engaging students with challenging thinking allows them to perform well on standardized testing and more conceptually challenging work.  Unfortunately, some students may be tracked into classes where they are subjected to rote learning (Stoddard, Tieso, & Robbins, 2015).  This critical and creative thinking must be available to all students.  Some students may already be enrolled in a band or chorus program, but this leaves a significant portion of the population not engaged with challenging work in an area of interest.  Student choice and self-directedness are often avoided because teachers fear a lack of productivity.  This is notably true for those who work with students of color, low socioeconomic status, and those with disabilities (Evans & Boucher, 2015).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Several approaches show promise in asking students to engage deeply with content in a meaningful way.  Inquiry-Based Learning is likely to engage students and lead to increased academic growth but had been mainly explored in science and math at the high school and collegiate level (Buchanan et al., 2016).  Play based curricular approaches ask students to engage deeply with the material, examine all angles and alternatives, take ownership for ideas, and take pride in their work (Macintyre Latta, Hanson, Ragoonaden, Briggs, & Middleton, 2017).  Some implementation of critical thinking and creative skills instruction have been as simple as one classroom project.  In a classroom project asking students to explore technology and add their own creative twist to create a vodcast, students had increased engagement and desire to learn, and the community of learners was enhanced (Shankar-Brown & Brown, 2014).</p>
      <br>
      <p>These approaches have many benefits for students.  Challenging thinking increases student performance on standardized assessment but more importantly provides them the skills to be successful in other mentally challenging tasks (Stoddard et al., 2015).    Learning through and with play involves developing a growth mindset that allows teacher and student to see mistakes not as a failure, but an opportunity to learn (Macintyre Latta et al., 2017).  This engagement with learning and creativity will help to foster the student connectedness needed for positive outcomes in both middle and high school. </p>
      <br>
      <p>For educators to implement creative, critical thinking, and play-based learning experiences, they must have time to plan, support from their administration, and help to build the confidence in their abilities (Macintyre Latta et al., 2017; Stoddard et al., 2015).  Many educators are reluctant to take time from their core content or to experiment during a regular class period at the risk of losing instructional time.  Thus, a curriculum designed to build creative and critical thinking courses based on student and teacher interest is a low-stakes way to build the skills necessary for student success.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Program Description</h2>
      <p>Expanded Opportunities is an additional non-core class period during the instructional day designed to build creative and critical thinking skills based on student and teacher interest as well as foster school connectedness. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Expanded Opportunities is a supplemental period implemented to replace a second study hall for 7th and 8th grade students while other students are enrolled in chorus or band.  Each course is designed as a stand-alone module.  Courses include explorations into reading and writing, math, science, social studies, arts, and other areas of interest.  Teachers use their knowledge base, interests, and specialized skills to design these stand-alone units that focus on critical and creative thinking.  Student learning is assessed either through a final-outcome project or reflections completed throughout the class.  There are no grades assigned for these classes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Teachers propose courses aligning with the PA Core Standards approximately half-way through a marking period.  Plans are reviewed and approved by the building principal and a ranking survey is sent out to the participating students.  Once the survey is complete, student feedback is provided to individual teachers, and students are scheduled into new classes based on their interest rankings.</p>

      <h1 class="title">Methodology</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Ethical Statement</h2>
      <p>The researcher used methods of obtaining information that were thorough, relevant to the community, and follow established methods for both gathering and analyzing data. Evaluation findings fully explain the limitations of the information gathered.  The researcher was honest and clear with teachers, students, and administration about my methods, purposes, and results for this evaluation. While the evaluation was cut short due to a pandemic, plans were made to ensure that all voices were heard, including those who oppose the program.  All information will remain confidential, and no participants will be identified. </p>
      <br>
        
      <h2 class="subtitle">Lesson Plan Review</h2> 
      <p>Lesson plans are stored in a shared staff Google Drive.  Because each new plan is essentially a new course, all plans are reviewed by the building principal for the following criteria: PA Core Standards aligned, includes creative and/or critical thinking, and students are asked to reflect on their learning.  The researchers reviewed all plans for courses offered during the first two marking periods of the 2019-2020 school year.  The researchers took note of standards, opportunities for creative and/or critical thinking, and opportunities for student and staff interactions during the lessons.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Survey of Students </h2> 
      <p>The student survey serves multiple purposes: provide feedback on each course that is sent to individual teachers, allow students voice and choice in their activity selection, and provide feedback on overall program direction.  It is administered each marking period at approximately the mid-way point.  All 7th graders take the survey in social studies class and all 8th graders take the survey in English class.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The survey has undergone many design revisions in order to better allow students to select their choices and provide more focused feedback.  Designed on Google Forms, it is a branching survey, so certain selections will lead to certain response opportunities.  Since students are incentivized to complete the survey by being given a choice as to their activities, the response rate is high. </p>
      <br>
        
      <h2 class="subtitle">Teacher Survey</h2> 
      <p>The teacher survey was designed for one-time administration but could be reused for further program revisions.  The teacher survey includes Likert-style items linked to the program assessment goals, open-ended responses for additional feedback, and also acts as a screener to obtain a purposeful sample for teacher semi-structured interviews.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Due to a state-wide school shutdown because of a global pandemic, the teacher survey was not administered.  It can be used to complete this evaluation at a later date. </p>
      <br>
        
      <h2 class="subtitle">Semi-Structured Teacher Interviews</h2> 
      <p>Semi-structured interviews were designed to be given to selected teachers at each grade who are responsible for instruction within the program.  The deep questioning, open-ended format is ideal for gaining a deeper understanding of whether or not the program is reaching its stated goals of providing critical and creative thinking activities and increasing school connectedness.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The interviews are designed to fit into the length of one planning period so that participants are not unduly inconvenienced.  The final version of the interview guide is produced in small packets with space for the interviewer to write responses.  Given that the questions are being asked at the respondents’ place of employment about their place of employment, recording the interview could be off-putting.</p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Interview Protocol</h2>
          <p>Good morning/afternoon!  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me over your planning today.  As you know, we’re trying to gain more information about how the expanded opportunities period is working and what could be done to improve it.  Your identity will be kept confidential, and you’re not obligated to answer any of the questions.</p>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>How many years have you been teaching in this district? The interviewer may prompt for more information about general experience. </li>
            <li>How would you describe your teaching style?</li>
            <li>What expanded opps has been your favorite to teach so far?  Why?</li>
            <li>What are your main goal or priorities when designing an expanded ops class?  Prompt for why these things are important.</li>
            <li>What things about the expanded opps period could be improved?  The interviewer may prompt for information as to why these things are concerns or how they could be improved.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>Thank you so much for your time today and for your insight. </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Semi-Structured Principal Interview</h2> 
      <p>Similar to the teacher interview, the principal interview is designed to assess whether the program is reaching the original goals of providing critical and creative thinking activities and increasing school connectedness.  The principal interview is designed to a 30-60 minute window.  The final version of the interview guide is produced in small packets with space for the interviewer to write responses.  Given that the questions are being asked at the respondents’ place of employment about their place of employment, recording the interview could be off-putting.  Because the principal will be identifiable based on being the only staff member to hold the position, the interview transcript derived from researcher notes will be returned to the principal for member checking.  Due to the school closure and temporary suspension of this program, the principal interview has not yet occurred.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Classroom Observations</h2>
      <p>Like the teacher survey and teacher and principal interviews, observations were not completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Observations will occur at a later date.  The purpose of the observations is to identify whether the program is meeting the goal of increasing school connectedness both student-to-student and student-to-teacher.  For this, a rating system that all participants are familiar with was selected, the Danielson Rubric.  This rubric is used for both formal and walk-through evaluations in this school, so the teachers and administrators are very familiar with the tool.</p>
      <br> 
      <p>Because the goal of the observations is to specifically observe for connectedness, only the relevant portion of the rubric will be used, specifically domain 2, the classroom environment. Consistent with all other walk-through observations in this building, the observer will be a non-participant.  The observer simply takes notes as to the activity occurring, and for the purpose of this observation, will be focused on teacher-to-student and student-to-student interactions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Following the observation, specific actions will be sorted into the appropriate category: creating an environment of respect and rapport, establishing a culture for learning, managing classroom procedures, managing student behavior, and organizing physical space.  Once sorted into categories, the evidence can be ranked as unsatisfactory, basic, proficient, or distinguished. </p>

        <h1 class="title">Key Findings</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Student Survey Results</h2>
        <p>The majority of students enjoyed the activities offered with 60.9% of respondents having a positive response to that question.   Student responses as to what they enjoyed about the activities varied from simply saying it was “fun,” saying that they learned a new skill, and that they enjoyed the time to be social during an activity.  Suggestions for course improvements included “nothing,” statements that the student did not care for the teacher, increasing student interaction, increasing interaction with the teacher, and statements that a particular skill was more difficult than anticipated.</p>
        <br>

        <div class="tile is-ancestor">
          <div class="tile is-child"></div>

          </div>
          <div class="tile is-child"></div>
        </div>
 
        <p>The majority of students also responded that EOP provided time for them to have fun and be social with other students.  This is supported by student responses in the open-ended section that enjoyable aspects included time to work and talk with other students.  In response to the question about having fun with the teacher, student response was not as positive as for the previous two questions with just under 50% of responses answering “agree” or “strongly agree.”  Student comments in the suggestions for improvement support this in statements made about not caring for a particular teacher or that the student wished for more time with the teacher for that specific activity.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Lesson Plan Review</h2>
        <p>During the first two marking periods of 2019-2020, 13 unique EOP courses were offered: breakout ED, creation station, skit performance, creative writing, origami scene design, game strategies, build your own board game, STEAM, ancient history STEM, applied science, critical decision making, chess, crochet, history through cinema.  Some courses were offered multiple marking periods. Some courses were taught to different groups on alternating days, and some teachers taught different courses on alternating days.   All lesson plans were present in the folder and contained the basic information of standards, the outline for an activity that met criteria of either creative or critical thinking and included a method for student reflection.  Most activities were either based around student-to-student interaction or allowed for it while working on independent projects.  The course with the least student interaction was creative writing which included built-in-time for peer conferencing and feedback.  The amount of staff interaction with students is not as clear from reading the plans.  Some courses, such as crochet, were based on significant teacher feedback while practicing and learning a new skill.  Other courses focused more on encouraging students to work as a team (breakout EDU, origami scene design, and applied science) and it was not possible to determine the intended level of teacher interaction with students.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Other</h2>
        <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and governor-ordered shutdown of all in-person instruction in Pennsylvania, the EOP class period was suspended for the remainder of the school year as the district transitioned to online instruction.  With a staff focus on supporting families and adapting lessons for distance instruction, it was not possible to complete the teacher survey or teacher and principal structured interviews.  As the course was discontinued for the remainder of the year, it was not possible to conduct classroom observations.  These tools are however already developed so that the program evaluation can continue when in-person instruction resumes.</p>
