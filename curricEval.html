      <h2 class="subtitle">Literature Review</h2>
      <p>Middle school is a vital and formational time in the lives of students.  What happens in middle school affects students during those years and future educational endeavors.  Student experiences in middle school are likely to impact students in the future in such areas as delinquency, attendance, and graduation (Tomek, Bolland, Hooper, Hitchcock, & Bolland, 2017).  Of course, these experiences also affect students in the moment.   School connectedness was found to be a key factor for Black students in predicting high school behaviors including enrollment during the final two years, school connectedness, and suspension.  In the middle school years, connectedness at that level does correlate with attendance and discipline during middle school (Tomek et al., 2017).  With the significance of connectedness and belonging during these years, it is essential for schools to develop programs that allow all students to gain a sense of belonging and engagement.</p>
      <br>
      <p>One standard way to attempt to foster school connection is through extracurriculars such as clubs and sports.  In a study of the Chinese school system, extracurriculars were found to not correlate to increased creative and critical thinking.  Students who were low achievers in mathematics were able to think creatively and critically and increased their math achievement with intervention (Liu, He, & Li, 2015). It is, therefore, necessary to foster connectedness through curricula that allow for creativity and critical thinking.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Student interest is a critical element in providing students with significant learning opportunities and often overlooked in school curriculums (Buchanan, Harlan, Bruce, & Edwards, 2016; Evans & Boucher, 2015).  Student interest without rigorous thinking is not enough, however.  The work provided needs to be of an appropriate difficulty level that provides a challenge while students believe that they can be successful (Evans & Boucher, 2015).  Care also needs to be taken in order to avoid choice overload which overwhelms students (Evans & Boucher, 2015).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Engaging students with challenging thinking allows them to perform well on standardized testing and more conceptually challenging work.  Unfortunately, some students may be tracked into classes where they are subjected to rote learning (Stoddard, Tieso, & Robbins, 2015).  This critical and creative thinking must be available to all students.  Some students may already be enrolled in a band or chorus program, but this leaves a significant portion of the population not engaged with challenging work in an area of interest.  Student choice and self-directedness are often avoided because teachers fear a lack of productivity.  This is notably true for those who work with students of color, low socioeconomic status, and those with disabilities (Evans & Boucher, 2015).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Several approaches show promise in asking students to engage deeply with content in a meaningful way.  Inquiry-Based Learning is likely to engage students and lead to increased academic growth but had been mainly explored in science and math at the high school and collegiate level (Buchanan et al., 2016).  Play based curricular approaches ask students to engage deeply with the material, examine all angles and alternatives, take ownership for ideas, and take pride in their work (Macintyre Latta, Hanson, Ragoonaden, Briggs, & Middleton, 2017).  Some implementation of critical thinking and creative skills instruction have been as simple as one classroom project.  In a classroom project asking students to explore technology and add their own creative twist to create a vodcast, students had increased engagement and desire to learn, and the community of learners was enhanced (Shankar-Brown & Brown, 2014).</p>
      <br>
      <p>These approaches have many benefits for students.  Challenging thinking increases student performance on standardized assessment but more importantly provides them the skills to be successful in other mentally challenging tasks (Stoddard et al., 2015).    Learning through and with play involves developing a growth mindset that allows teacher and student to see mistakes not as a failure, but an opportunity to learn (Macintyre Latta et al., 2017).  This engagement with learning and creativity will help to foster the student connectedness needed for positive outcomes in both middle and high school. </p>
      <br>
      <p>For educators to implement creative, critical thinking, and play-based learning experiences, they must have time to plan, support from their administration, and help to build the confidence in their abilities (Macintyre Latta et al., 2017; Stoddard et al., 2015).  Many educators are reluctant to take time from their core content or to experiment during a regular class period at the risk of losing instructional time.  Thus, a curriculum designed to build creative and critical thinking courses based on student and teacher interest is a low-stakes way to build the skills necessary for student success.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Program Description</h2>
      <p>Expanded Opportunities is an additional non-core class period during the instructional day designed to build creative and critical thinking skills based on student and teacher interest as well as foster school connectedness. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Expanded Opportunities is a supplemental period implemented to replace a second study hall for 7th and 8th grade students while other students are enrolled in chorus or band.  Each course is designed as a stand-alone module.  Courses include explorations into reading and writing, math, science, social studies, arts, and other areas of interest.  Teachers use their knowledge base, interests, and specialized skills to design these stand-alone units that focus on critical and creative thinking.  Student learning is assessed either through a final-outcome project or reflections completed throughout the class.  There are no grades assigned for these classes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Teachers propose courses aligning with the PA Core Standards approximately half-way through a marking period.  Plans are reviewed and approved by the building principal and a ranking survey is sent out to the participating students.  Once the survey is complete, student feedback is provided to individual teachers, and students are scheduled into new classes based on their interest rankings.</p>
