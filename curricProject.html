<h1>Curriculum Project Proposal</h1>
<section id="Description" class="main-section">
<header>Description</header>
<p> This interdisciplinary proposal seeks to create new course content for a middle school in central Pennsylvania.  Middle schoolers enrolled in this district all complete the same set of mandated electives each year with little student choice.  Students are all enrolled in the same level English, science, and social studies classes with the exceptions of students needing more intensive learning support.  Instruction for different sections of each course varies little due to each course being taught by only one instructor at each level.  There are three tracked options of math available.  Once a student is placed in math, it is very difficult to change levels.  Currently, there are two periods a day that function as structured study halls.  This proposal would take one of those periods to build an exploratory curriculum based on student and teacher interests incorporating critical and creative thinking skills that will be known as expanded options.  These courses will function as a supplement to the core curriculum. </p>
<p>The expanded options courses will be designed as stand-alone units so that students may take them in any order during their two middle school years.  Each course will have its own instructional sequence, but there is no overall scope needed for the program. </p>
<p>Courses will include explorations into reading and writing, math, science, social studies, arts, and other areas of interest.  Each course will build upon teacher knowledge and specialized skills, include critical and creative thinking, and build towards a final outcome project for students that may be completed individually or in groups.  Academically based play and inquiry-based learning are possible approaches that may be used within courses.  All courses will be aligned with PA Core or content area standards. </p>
<p>Initial course topic selection will occur at the end of the 2017-2018 school year with development to occur before the start of the 2018-2019 school year.  Students will initially be placed into courses based on intact groupings.  Cycles will be approximately 22 school days in duration with the possibility to operate on an A/B schedule. As the first course cycle nears its completion, students will be asked to rank the course offerings for the second cycle and be placed based on preference. This preference will be taken into account when creating student schedules.  At the end of the first cycle, students and teachers will be asked to provide evaluative and reflective feedback. </p>
<p>During the second cycle, feedback from the first cycle will be used to meet with teachers and discuss further improvements, addition of courses, and elimination of courses.  Development of additional topics will be based on student interest and teacher ability.  The cycle of selection and reflection will continue throughout the 2018-2019 academic year. </p>

<header>Literature Review</header>
  <p>Middle school is a vital and formational time in the lives of students.  What happens in middle school affects those years and future educational endeavors.  Student experiences in middle school are likely to impact students in the future in such areas as delinquency, attendance, and graduation (Tomek, Bolland, Hooper, Hitchcock, & Bolland, 2017).  Of course, these experiences also affect students in the moment.   School connectedness was found to be a key factor for Black students in predicting high school behaviors including enrollment during the final two years, school connectedness, and suspension.  In the middle school years, connectedness at that level does correlate with attendance and discipline during middle school (Tomek et al., 2017).  With the significance of connectedness and belonging during these years, it is essential for schools to develop programs that allow all students to gain a sense of belonging and engagement.</p>
  <p>One standard way to attempt to foster school connection is through extracurriculars such as clubs and sports.  In a study of the Chinese school system, extracurriculars were found to not correlate to increased creative and critical thinking.  Students who were low achievers in mathematics were able to think creatively and critically and increased their math achievement with intervention (Liu, He, & Li, 2015). It is, therefore, necessary to foster connectedness through curricula that allow for creativity and critical thinking. </p>
  <p>Student interest is a critical element in providing students with significant learning opportunities and often overlooked in school curriculums (Buchanan, Harlan, Bruce, & Edwards, 2016; Evans & Boucher, 2015).  Student interest without rigorous thinking is not enough, however.  The work provided needs to be of an appropriate difficulty level that provides a challenge while students believe that they can be successful (Evans & Boucher, 2015).  Care also needs to be taken in order to avoid choice overload which overwhelms students (Evans & Boucher, 2015). </p>
  <p>Engaging students with challenging thinking allows them to perform well on standardized testing and more conceptually challenging work.  Unfortunately, some students may be tracked into classes where they are subjected to rote learning (Stoddard, Tieso, & Robbins, 2015).  This critical and creative thinking must be available to all students.  Some students may already be enrolled in a band or chorus program, but this leaves a significant portion of the population not engaged with challenging work in an area of interest.  Student choice and self-directedness are often avoided because teachers fear a lack of productivity.  This is notably true for those who work with students of color, low socioeconomic status, and those with disabilities (Evans & Boucher, 2015). </p>
  <p>Several approaches show promise in asking students to engage deeply with content in a meaningful way.  Inquiry-based Learning is likely to engage students and lead to increased academic growth but had been mainly explored in science and math at the high school and collegiate level (Buchanan et al., 2016).  Play based curricular approaches ask students to engage deeply with the material, examine all angles and alternatives, take ownership for ideas, and take pride in their work (Macintyre Latta, Hanson, Ragoonaden, Briggs, & Middleton, 2017).  Some implementation of critical thinking and creative skills instruction have been as simple as one classroom project.  In a classroom project asking students to explore technology and add their own creative twist to create a vodcast, students had increased engagement and desire to learn, and the community of learners was enhanced (Shankar-Brown & Brown, 2014). </p>
  <p>These approaches have many benefits for students.  Challenging thinking increases student performance on standardized assessment but more importantly provides them the skills to be successful in other mentally challenging tasks (Stoddard et al., 2015).    Learning through and with play involves developing a growth mindset that allows teacher and student to see mistakes not as a failure, but an opportunity to learn (Macintyre Latta et al., 2017).  This engagement with learning and creativity will help to foster the student connectedness needed for positive outcomes in both middle and high school.  </p>
  <p>For educators to implement creative, critical thinking, and play-based learning experiences, they must have time to plan, support from their administration, and help to build the confidence in their abilities (Macintyre Latta et al., 2017; Stoddard et al., 2015).  Many educators are reluctant to take time from their core content or to experiment during a regular class period at the risk of losing instructional time.  Thus, a curriculum designed to build creative and critical thinking courses based on student and teacher interest is a low-stakes way to build the skills necessary for student success. </p>

  <p>For educators to implement creative, critical thinking, and play-based learning experiences, they must have time to plan, support from their administration, and help to build the confidence in their abilities (Macintyre Latta et al., 2017; Stoddard et al., 2015).  Many educators are reluctant to take time from their core content or to experiment during a regular class period at the risk of losing instructional time.  Thus, a curriculum designed to build creative and critical thinking courses based on student and teacher interest is a low-stakes way to build the skills necessary for student success. </p>
  <p>Initial course topics will be selected through collaboration with school staff and administration.  The design will be a collaborative process with teacher input for their content knowledge and be structured around providing students with exploration, critical thinking, and creative thinking in alignment with existing PA Core or content standards for the appropriate grade.  The courses will be designed as stand-alone electives that can be taken independently of one another and in any order to allow students to explore and engage with a variety of areas throughout the year.  The courses designed may be offered multiple times, revised based on student and teacher feedback, or replaced with more relevant material.  Each course will involve a final outcome project that will vary based on the content selected.  The final outcome project could be a student product, presentation, or learning reflection log. Students and teachers will be asked to reflect on each course following its completion and observations will be conducted. </p>
  <p>The project will be presented through middle school staff meetings that occur on a monthly basis.  Additional time to work with staff on developing plans and reflecting on implementation may occur in segments during building specific professional development time.  The development will be ongoing throughout the year.  Staff development needed will include education on the rationale for the project and developing appropriate courses.  Staff strengths include a variety of interests that would appeal to students.  A log will be kept of all professional development activity.  </p>
  <p>Following the completion of the project, a self-reflective write-up may be completed and presented at relevant conferences or to appropriate publications.  Should a qualitative case study be desired for publication, an IRB and RTAF would be completed first. </p>

  <p>The effectiveness will be determined through student final outcome projects, documentation of observations conducted, and records of surveys completed by students and teachers each cycle.  Further, feedback will be solicited from the building principal throughout the project.</p>
